# END-TO-END-FLASK-APP
In this project i have created a website in which we can search for the lyrics for the songs that you are looking for.
In this project i initially created a postgres database with the help of the docker and in that database i stored the data of the songs which i collected from the internet.
Then i craeted a weebsite using python and html which mainly contain the Home page, Search page, Latest songs page and a page for adding new songs.
